// Q) Rat in a Maze â€“ A maze is an N*N binary matrix of blocks where the upper left block is known as the Source
// block, and the lower rightmost block is known as the Destination block. If we consider the maze, then maze[0][0]
// is the source, and maze[N-1][N-1] is the destination. Our main task is to reach the destination from the
// source. We have considered a rat as a character that can move either forward or downwards.
// In the maze matrix, a few dead blocks will be denoted by 0 and active blocks will be denoted by 1. A rat can
// move only in the active blocks.
